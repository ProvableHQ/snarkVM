Two shell scripts are provided to assist you to use the appropriate runners with the least effort on your part.

## Use CircleCI runners
To use the runners while developing in the AleoHQ/ProvableHQ CircleCI use the use_circleci_runners.sh script.

## Use Self Hosted Runners
Once you have a passing build, and you are ready to commit your code switch back using the use_self_hosted_runners.sh script.

You should see no changes to the .circleci/config.yml when you submit your PR to the upstream repo.
